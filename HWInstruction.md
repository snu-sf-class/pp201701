# Instructions for Homework Submission

We provide a web server for the homework submission. The server checks your code and shows you the result of very basic tests.

1. Go to http://147.46.219.145:8101/
2. Log in. ID/PW are your student ID number. (ex. ID:2017-12345 / PW: 2017-12345)
3. Change your password. Otherwise, you CANNOT submit your assignments.
4. Click HW number (currently, 1)
5. Compress your `src` folder to `.zip` file. When we extract the zip file, we should obtain the `src` folder.
  + ex. Right click your `src` folder and compress.
6. Click `Choose File` and upload your `.zip` file, and then click `Submit`.
7. You can see the status of your file.
  + RUNNING: The server is running. Wait a moment.
  + SYSTEM ERROR: Some error on the server occurs. Ask TA.
  + COMPILE ERROR: The server fails compiling your code.
  + SUCCESS: The server succeeds to compile your code. Read the result message.
  + MISSING FILES: Check you compressed in the right way. Try extract your zip file and check whether it generates the `src` folder.
